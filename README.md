Smart Water Monitoring Dashboard (Live Operational View)

This dashboard represents the real-time operational interface of the smart water management system. It visualizes critical hydraulic parameters such as main pipeline flow rate, system pressure, total branch flow, and individual branch flow and pressure values. Each gauge provides an intuitive overview of the system status, allowing rapid detection of abnormal conditions such as pressure drops, uneven flow distribution, or inactive branches.
