Embedded Hardware Prototype and Control Unit

These Images presents the physical prototype of the smart water monitoring system. It integrates an ESP32S, Arduino Mega microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensing modules, LED status indicators, an LCD display, Flow & Pressure Sensors Holder, and a regulated power supply module. The prototype demonstrates how sensor data is acquired, processed, and displayed locally, forming the core of the system’s embedded intelligence.

The hardware prototype validates the feasibility of a low-cost, scalable solution for real-time water monitoring. It serves as a practical proof-of-concept that connects simulation results, field measurements, and digital dashboards, and can be easily expanded to include wireless communication, cloud integration, or renewable energy sources.
