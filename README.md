Smart Water Monitoring Dashboard (Live Operational View)

This dashboard represents the real-time operational interface of the smart water management system. It visualizes critical hydraulic parameters such as main pipeline flow rate, system pressure, total branch flow, and individual branch flow and pressure values. Each gauge provides an intuitive overview of the system status, allowing rapid detection of abnormal conditions such as pressure drops, uneven flow distribution, or inactive branches.

The dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for operators and engineers by enabling continuous performance monitoring, early leakage detection, and data-driven operational adjustments. It is particularly effective for daily supervision, fault diagnosis, and validating system stability under different operating conditions.
