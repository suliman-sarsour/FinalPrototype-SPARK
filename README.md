Physical Layout and System Zoning Representation

This schematic illustrates the physical layout of the smart water distribution system at the site level. It highlights the main supply line, distribution branches, irrigation zones, and monitoring-control points. The zoning approach allows the system to be segmented into independently monitored and controlled areas, improving operational flexibility and fault isolation.

Such a representation bridges the gap between hydraulic modeling and real-world deployment. It ensures proper alignment between network design, sensor placement, and controlled irrigation or consumption zones, making it suitable for agricultural, institutional, or community-scale applications.
