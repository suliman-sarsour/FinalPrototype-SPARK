EPANET Hydraulic Network Simulation Model

This figure shows the hydraulic simulation model developed using EPANET 2.2, representing the backbone of the system’s design and validation process. The network consists of a storage tank, a main transmission line, and multiple distribution branches. Each node displays calculated pressure values, while each pipe segment shows flow direction and magnitude at a specific simulation time.

The model enables engineers to analyze pressure distribution, head losses, and flow balance across the network. It is a critical tool for system optimization, allowing the evaluation of design alternatives, pipe sizing, and operational scenarios before physical implementation, thus reducing cost and risk.
